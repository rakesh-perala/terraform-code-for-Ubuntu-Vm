************************************************************Here's a reusable and industry-acceptable Terraform code setup for deploying an Ubuntu VM using Terraform. The setup includes a main.tf file containing the core logic and a variables.tf file defining all the variables to keep the code modular and easy to reuse.

How to Use code 
*****************************

Explanation
Reusability: The code is modular, with variables defined in a separate file, making it easy to reuse and adapt for different environments.
Industry Standards: The use of separate files for main logic, variables, and variable values (terraform.tfvars) follows best practices for clean and maintainable Terraform code.
SSH Key-Based Authentication: This setup disables password authentication, following security best practices by using SSH keys.
This structure allows for flexibility in creating multiple environments (e.g., dev, prod) with minimal changes to the code.
